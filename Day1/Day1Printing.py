print("Hello World!") #prints out the string that is in the "" (show the beginning of the string) into the console
#pieces of text are called strings
print("print('something')")

#or use print('something if you want to use "" in the string')
#example:
print('print("something")')

#to print something in a new line use \n
#example: 
print("Hello World!\nHello World2!") #structure: print("something\nsomething2")

#To combine two strings in one sentence use a + between each string (important to know: there will be no space between the two words unless you add one)
#It is called "String Concatenation"
#example:
print("Hello" + " Joel")
