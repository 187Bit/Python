input("What is your name?") #ask the user to enter something (similar to the &scan funtion in fmt)
#Structure: input("A prompt for the user")
#Effect: prints out the prompt and waits for an input of the user in the terminal 

#You can print out the input that the user typed in:
#input() will get the users input in the console
#Then print() will print out the "Hello" and the input of the user
print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))

#To get the lenght of a string you can use the len() funtion
#input() will ask the user for it's name
#len() will then get the lenght of the string
#print() will print out the length of the string
print(len(input("What is your name?")))
